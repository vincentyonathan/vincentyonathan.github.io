                <p>
                    "This popular Jakarta dish is widely considered Indonesia’s parallel to Korea’s kimchi. And just like kimchi, 
                    asinan comes in several variations. Generally, the refreshingly salty and sour dish comes as a mix of pickled 
                    vegetables, namely bean sprouts, tofu, lettuce and Chinese cabbage, doused in a sauce blend of spicy, sour and 
                    sweet. Toppings vary, usually combining peanuts and shrimp crackers that balance this surprisingly flavourful delight."

                     and offal in its servings, and some variations include mutton and even buffalo meat. Another has rice vermicelli, potatoes and 
                     tomatoes. A serving of soto is usually enjoyed with an accompanying plate of steamed rice, or slices of lontong rice cake.
                     Lime juice and sweet or salted soy sauce is sprinkled over the soup by the customer for rich flavour."

                <p>
                    "Kue Rangi or Rangi Cake is made from sago flour mixed with shredded coconut and served with a splash of palm sugar sauce. Cuts of 
                    fruits are usually added into the platter. Flavorful and aromatic, with its shape 
                    resembles a kue pancong (another Indonesia cake). The taste of the shredded cocount and sago is unique and savory combined with the sweet 
                    taste of the palm sugar sauce makes it a perfect snack for the day. Not to mention the price which is relatively cheap."

                <p>
                    "Es Selendang Mayang is a refreshingly tasty and texture-rich compote dish with slices of gelatinous cakes called ‘hunkwe’ as its main 
                    ingredient. The ‘soup’ is a mixture of boiled brown sugar, aromatic pandan leaves, coconut milk, vanilla and salt and sugar added to taste. 
                    The dessert is served cold, with ice cubes added. The taste is delicious, especially on hot days. It is somewhat similar to Cendol, another 
                    Indonesian sweet dessert."
